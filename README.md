# TrainSim Enhancement with Real-World Data

## Overview
This project extends the TrainSim simulation platform by integrating real-world geographic data from OpenStreetMap. The goal is to simulate realistic train routes and dynamics using enhanced routing and control algorithms.

## Features
- Route computation from OpenStreetMap data
- Generation of optimal speed profiles
- Realistic simulation of train dynamics
- Export of synthetic datasets with physical accuracy

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Jupyter Notebook
